To do so, we equiped the window with a LIDAR and invited people to defrost it to reveal Audi&amp;rsquo;s cars.
As a back-end developer, I was in charge of gathering data from the LIDAR and creating the architecture of the application.
All the pictures below are provided by SUPERBIEN.

The constrain for this project was to make the technology as invisible as possible.
To make the wall touch-sensitive, we hid capacitive sensors behind it to create interactive zones. This project was realy fun to work on since it also introduced lots of types of physical interactions with the wall.</description></item><item><title>Oceans</title><link>/portfolio/oceans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/oceans/</guid><description>Ocean is a virtual immersive aqurium I worked on with SUPERBIEN. A total of 11 LIDARs made the 300 meters square video content interactive.
As a backend-developer, I was in charge of creating a standalone application that would allow to easily preview the data gathered by the LIDARs over the network, calibrate it (re-align the LIDARS on a 2D canvas) and perform blob-tracking on that set of data. This eventually gave birth to the LIDAR App on which you&amp;rsquo;ll have more information in a dedicated article.</description></item></channel></rss>
