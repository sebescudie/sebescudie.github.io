To do so, we equiped the window with a LIDAR and invited people to defrost it to reveal Audi&amp;rsquo;s cars.
As a back-end developer, I was in charge of gathering data from the LIDAR and creating the architecture of the application.

For both occasions, SUPERBIEN was asked to conceptualize and design the Super Club, turning the Grand Palais of Paris into a night club for one week.
As a backend-developer for SUPERBIEN, I worked on the 2015 edition with Alex Le Guillou to create Michel, a generative VJing software made with vvvv beta.</description></item><item><title>EDF Interactive Wall</title><link>/portfolio/edf-interactive-wall/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/edf-interactive-wall/</guid><description>In 2016, SUPERBIEN was asked by AUDITOIRE to create a giant touch senstive wall for EDF&amp;rsquo;s (national electricity company) booth at Viva Tech faire. The constrain for this project was to make the technology as invisible as possible.
As a back-end developer, I was in charge of sourcing the appropriate electronics and laying out the architecture of the application. I also developed some of the mini games that users would play on the wall.</description></item><item><title>Oceans</title><link>/portfolio/oceans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/oceans/</guid><description>Oceans is a virtual immersive aquarium I worked on with SUPERBIEN for MK2+ and Altarea Cogedim. A total of 11 LIDARs made the 300 meters square video content interactive.
As a backend-developer, I was in charge of creating a standalone application that would allow to easily preview the data gathered by the LIDARs over the network, calibrate it (re-align the LIDARS on a 2D canvas) and perform blob-tracking on that set of data.</description></item><item><title>Première Pièce</title><link>/portfolio/escapegame/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/escapegame/</guid><description>In 2016, Google created an ephemeral escape game in Paris, named Première Pièce. SUPERBIEN was asked by WE ARE SOCIAL to create video content and interactive experiences for it.
Players had to go through several mini-riddles to finish the game, like searching for items in a high resolution painting that was controlled by their movements, or stepping at the right spot in the room to unlock new clues to carry on.</description></item></channel></rss>
