To do so, we equiped the window with a LIDAR and invited people to defrost it to reveal Audi&amp;rsquo;s cars.
As a back-end developer, I was in charge of gathering data from the LIDAR and creating the architecture of the application.
All the pictures below are provided by SUPERBIEN.

For both occasions, SUPERBIEN was asked to conceptualize and design the Super Club, turning the Grand Palais of Paris into a night club for one week.
As a backend-developer for SUPERBIEN, I worked on the 2015 edition with Alex Le Guillou to create Michel, a generative VJing software made with vvvv beta.</description></item><item><title>EDF Interactive Wall</title><link>/portfolio/edf-interactive-wall/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/edf-interactive-wall/</guid><description>In 2016, SUPERBIEN was asked to create a giant touch senstive wall for EDF&amp;rsquo;s (national electricity company) booth at Viva Tech faire. The constrain for this project was to make the technology as invisible as possible.
As a back-end developer, I was in charge of sourcing the appropriate electronics and laying out the architecture of the application. I also developed some of the mini games that users would play on the wall.</description></item><item><title>Oceans</title><link>/portfolio/oceans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/oceans/</guid><description>Ocean is a virtual immersive aqurium I worked on with SUPERBIEN. A total of 11 LIDARs made the 300 meters square video content interactive.
As a backend-developer, I was in charge of creating a standalone application that would allow to easily preview the data gathered by the LIDARs over the network, calibrate it (re-align the LIDARS on a 2D canvas) and perform blob-tracking on that set of data. This eventually gave birth to the LIDAR App on which you&amp;rsquo;ll have more information in a dedicated article.</description></item><item><title>Première Pièce</title><link>/portfolio/escapegame/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/escapegame/</guid><description>In 2016, Google created an ephemeral escape game in Paris, named Première Pièce. SUPERBIEN was asked to create video content and interactive experiences for it.
Players had to go through several mini-riddles to finish the game, like searching for items in a high resolution painting that was controlled by their movements, or stepping at the right spot in the room to unlock new clues to carry on.
As a back-end developer, I was in charge of creating the experiences themselves (in collaboration with graphic designers), as well as developing the admnistration interface of the game.</description></item></channel></rss>
