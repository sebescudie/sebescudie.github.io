A total of 11 LIDARs made the 300 meters square video content interactive.
As a backend-developer, I was in charge of creating a standalone application that would allow to easily preview the data gathered by the LIDARs over the network, calibrate it (re-align the LIDARS on a 2D canvas) and perform blob-tracking on that set of data.</description></item><item><title>Out Of Control</title><link>/portfolio/outofcontrol/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/outofcontrol/</guid><description>In 2014, I worked with Visual System on Out Of Control, a sound and light installation in Brussel&amp;rsquo;s Atomium. The installation is based on an original novel by french author St√©phane Beauverger, and explores the relation between human beings and machines, and more specificaly the question of singularity : &amp;ldquo;the inevitable rise of the Super Machine&amp;rdquo;.
On my side, no programming involved this time : I was part of the technical team that set up the installation.</description></item></channel></rss>
