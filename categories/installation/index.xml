A total of 11 LIDARs made the 300 meters square video content interactive.
As a backend-developer, I was in charge of creating a standalone application that would allow to easily preview the data gathered by the LIDARs over the network, calibrate it (re-align the LIDARS on a 2D canvas) and perform blob-tracking on that set of data. This eventually gave birth to the LIDAR App on which you&amp;rsquo;ll have more information in a dedicated article.</description></item></channel></rss>
