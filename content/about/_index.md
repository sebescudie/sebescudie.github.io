i've  been working for 5 years at [SUPERBIEN](superbien.studio) in paris where i was in charge of back-end development for interactive installations. my weapon of choice is the [vvvv](vvvv.org) programming language (be it beta or gamma). i can also write C#, and have some experience working with Unity. i also enjoy python very much but eh, not quite there yet.

beside that, i'm contributing to the development of [VL.Elementa](https://github.com/vvvv-dottore/VL.Elementa/), a GUI library for the VL programming language, and i enjoy wrapping libraries for VVVV Gamma, as you can see on my [github profile](https://github.com/sebescudie).

i'm also a vvvv teacher at the [Node Institute](thenodeinstitute.org).

if you want to discuss a project or just speak, drop me a line!
