In 2016, the Audi City store in Paris asked [SUPERBIEN](http://superbien.studio) to turn its window into a mini advent-calendar. To do so, we equiped the window with a LIDAR and invited people to defrost it to reveal Audi's cars.

As a back-end developer, I was in charge of gathering data from the LIDAR and creating the architecture of the application.

All the pictures below are provided by SUPERBIEN.
