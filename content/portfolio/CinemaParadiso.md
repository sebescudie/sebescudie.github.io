Cinema Paradiso is an event organized by MK2 Group in 2013 and 2015 to "celebrate the culture of cinema and entertainment in all its diversity". For both occasions, [SUPERBIEN](https://www.superbien.studio/work/cinema-paradiso-superclub) was asked to conceptualize and design the Super Club, turning the Grand Palais of Paris into a night club for one week.

As a backend-developer for SUPERBIEN, I worked on the 2015 edition with [Alex Le Guillou](https://alexleguillou.com/) to create _Michel_, a generative VJing software made with vvvv beta. _Michel_ was able to generate 2D patterns and apply postfx to those. The pattern and the effets were hookable to audio analysis values or MIDI controls on the fly.

All the pictures below are provided by SUPERBIEN.
