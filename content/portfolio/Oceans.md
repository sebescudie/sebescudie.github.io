Ocean is a virtual immersive aqurium I worked on with [SUPERBIEN](https://www.superbien.studio/work/oceans). A total of 11 LIDARs made the 300 meters square video content interactive.

As a backend-developer, I was in charge of creating a standalone application that would allow to easily preview the data gathered by the LIDARs over the network, calibrate it (re-align the LIDARS on a 2D canvas) and perform blob-tracking on that set of data. This eventually gave birth to the LIDAR App on which you'll have more information in a [dedicated article](https://sebescudie.github.io/sebescudie.github.io/portfolio/lidar-app/).
