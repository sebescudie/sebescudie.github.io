In 2014, I worked with [Visual System](https://visualsystem.org/) on [Out Of Control](https://visualsystem.org/project/out-of-control), a sound and light installation in Brussel's Atomium. The installation is based on an original novel by french author St√©phane Beauverger, and explores the relation between human beings and machines, and more specificaly the question of singularity : "the inevitable rise of the Super Machine".

On my side, no programming involved this time : I was part of the technical team that set up the installation.
