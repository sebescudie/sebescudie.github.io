Gamma Launcher is a small GUI application (patched with vvvv gamma!) that allows you to start a specific vvvv version installed on your system, and add startup options such as `-m` (allow multiple instances) or `--package-repositories` (overrides your nugets with those from your development folder).

To get it, simply head over to the [release section](https://github.com/sebescudie/GammaLauncher/releases) of the [Github repo](https://github.com/sebescudie/GammaLauncher).
