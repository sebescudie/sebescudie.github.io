In 2016, [SUPERBIEN was asked to create a giant touch senstive wall](https://www.superbien.studio/work/edf-viva-technology) for EDF's (national electricity company) booth at Viva Tech faire. The constrain for this project was to make the technology as invisible as possible. 

To make the wall touch-sensitive, we hid capacitive sensors behind it to create interactive zones. This project was realy fun to work on since it also introduced lots of types of physical interactions with the wall.

As a back-end developer, I was in charge of sourcing the appropriate sensors and laying out the architecture of the application. I also developed some of the mini games that users would play on the wall.

All the images and videos below are provided by SUPERBIEN.
